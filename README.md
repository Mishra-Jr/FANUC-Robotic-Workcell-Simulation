### ðŸ¤– Workcells Designed

This project involved the complete simulation of three distinct robotic workcells, each designed for a specific industrial application.

#### 1. Machine Tending (Robot: R-2000iC/165F)
* **Objective:** To automate the process of loading and unloading heavy parts from a CNC machine to maintain a 24-hour production cycle.
* **Tasks:**
    * Securely picking up raw parts using a pneumatic gripper.
    * Precisely loading parts into a CNC lathe, synchronized with the machine's operational status.
    * Unloading finished parts and moving them to a designated area.
* **Key Skills:** Robot selection based on payload (165 kg) and reach (3095 mm), cycle time analysis, and workcell synchronization.

#### 2. Palletizing (Robot: CRX-20iA/L)
* **Objective:** To efficiently pick uniform cubes from a conveyor and place them into a large box, maintaining a strict 10-second cycle time.
* **Tasks:**
    * Picking parts from a conveyor using a vacuum gripper triggered by sensors.
    * Strategically placing parts into a box capable of holding 270 items to maximize space.
* **Key Skills:** Collaborative robot programming, sensor integration, and high-speed pick-and-place optimization.

#### 3. Kitting (Robot: CRX-20iA/L)
* **Objective:** To assemble a kit of five distinct and non-uniform parts into a kitting box.
* **Tasks:**
    * Handling parts of various shapes and orientations using an electric parallel gripper.
    * Utilizing the robot's 6-axis capability for precise placement of each unique part.
* **Key Skills:** Adaptive gripping, precision placement, and quality assurance through sensor feedback.
