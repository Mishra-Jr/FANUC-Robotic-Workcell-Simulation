### ðŸ¤– Workcells Designed

This project involved the complete simulation of three distinct robotic workcells, each designed for a specific industrial application.

#### 1. Machine Tending (Robot: R-2000iC/165F)
* [cite_start]**Objective:** To automate the process of loading and unloading heavy parts from a CNC machine to maintain a 24-hour production cycle. 
* **Tasks:**
    * [cite_start]Securely picking up raw parts using a pneumatic gripper. 
    * [cite_start]Precisely loading parts into a CNC lathe, synchronized with the machine's operational status. 
    * [cite_start]Unloading finished parts and moving them to a designated area. 
* [cite_start]**Key Skills:** Robot selection based on payload (165 kg) and reach (3095 mm), cycle time analysis, and workcell synchronization. 

#### 2. Palletizing (Robot: CRX-20iA/L)
* [cite_start]**Objective:** To efficiently pick uniform cubes from a conveyor and place them into a large box, maintaining a strict 10-second cycle time. 
* **Tasks:**
    * [cite_start]Picking parts from a conveyor using a vacuum gripper triggered by sensors. 
    * [cite_start]Strategically placing parts into a box capable of holding 270 items to maximize space. 
* **Key Skills:** Collaborative robot programming, sensor integration, and high-speed pick-and-place optimization.

#### 3. Kitting (Robot: CRX-20iA/L)
* [cite_start]**Objective:** To assemble a kit of five distinct and non-uniform parts into a kitting box. 
* **Tasks:**
    * [cite_start]Handling parts of various shapes and orientations using an electric parallel gripper. 
    * [cite_start]Utilizing the robot's 6-axis capability for precise placement of each unique part. 
* [cite_start]**Key Skills:** Adaptive gripping, precision placement, and quality assurance through sensor feedback.
